My experience started with a <â‚¬150/day average restaurant in the heart of Waterford. It turned profitable within 3 months of implementing my systems and is now doing better than ever. Doing that, I discovered my passion for reviving dreams and encouraging restaurants to thrive.\n\n" +

As an extremely systematic and resourceful person, I've found my purpose in getting restaurant owners out of that slump. Because seeing their face shine once again when seeing their thriving store can keep me going forever.\n\n" +
