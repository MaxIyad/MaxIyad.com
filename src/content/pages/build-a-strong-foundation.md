# Foundation:

A restaurant's foundation is easy to understand but hard to implement.

Without it, stores won't survive the slightest setback.

Here are 3 questions the best owners use to determine:

- Pricing
- Food costs
- Overhead (is it overpriced?)
- Business validity



## 1. **Who's your typical customer?**

For whatever reason, this is a widespread phenomenon:

My client's marketing efforts are (almost) always applied to an outside group.

Which significantly increases acquisition cost with far less return.

## 2. **How much are they willing to pay?**

This is unfortunately a universal truth:

Business owners average their competitors' pricing,

And set their prices ~20% lower thinking it makes them competitive.

Don't fall into this trap (please.)

## 3. **How many potential customers are needed per day?**

This will be in the form of a percentage. 

Think of it as your conversion rate per impression.

This is averaged across all your outreach methods.

Estimate if there's enough (online & offline) traffic to convert.


# Outcome:

Everything hinges on small restaurant owners getting this right.

Without these numbers, any restaurant is simply guessing until they land on something that works. Which may be too late.

Don't continue with a flimsy foundation
